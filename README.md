## Machine Learning University: Responsible AI

This repository contains __slides__, __notebooks__, and __data__ for the __Machine Learning University (MLU) Responsible AI__ class. Our mission is to make Machine Learning accessible to everyone. We have courses available across many topics of machine learning and believe knowledge of ML can be a key enabler for success. This class is designed to help you get started with Responsible AI, learn about widely used Machine Learning techniques, and apply them to real-world problems.

__Final Project:__ Practice working with a "real-world" dataset for the final project. Final project dataset is in the [data/final_project folder](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-responsible-ai/tree/master/data/final_project). For more details on the final project, check out [this notebook](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-responsible-ai/blob/main/notebooks/day_1/MLA-RESML-DAY1-FINAL-STUDENT-NB.ipynb).
